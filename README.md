The purpose of this thesis is to design a didactic station with a manipulator test the accuracy and precision of a given manipulator controlled by 4 servos using the PWM signal for rotation, the PWM signal and the angle of rotation will be calculated by a algorithm written in MATLAB. The written algorithm will be uploaded to the Raspberry Pi through the "deployment" process. According to the assumptions, the station should have an embedded system - Raspberry Pi, a manipulator, a regulated power supply, and access to a MATLAB program. All elements are mounted on "Golding" connectors, which facilitates quick replacement in the event of damage. After the station is assembled, it was checked and tested. Several programs were also launched to test the wireless connection and the operation of each servo.
